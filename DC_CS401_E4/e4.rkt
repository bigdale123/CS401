;; Exercises 4: merge-sort and line-coverage problem

(provide merge-sort
         line-coverage)

; Use merge-sort to efficiently sort a list recursively
(define (merge-sort lst <=)

; Line coverage: take a list of lines, each encoded as a list `(,s ,e) where s <= e 
; and both are integers, and compute the overall amount of area covered.
; For example, (line-coverage '((4 9) (1 2) (6 12) (99 99))) => 9
