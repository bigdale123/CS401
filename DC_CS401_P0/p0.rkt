;; Project 0: complete five simple functions

(provide implies-value
         append-string
         median-of-three
         point-distance
         shortest-distance)


; Compute the truth value of the proposition "x --> y" where x and y are booleans
(define (implies-value x y)
  'todo)

; takes two "strings", and appends the larger string to the smaller string
; if they are the same size, keep the original order (str1, str2)
(define (append-string str1 str2)
  'todo)

; Compute the median of three integers
(define (median-of-three x y z)
  'todo)

; Compute the distance between two (x,y) pairs of integers
(define (point-distance x0 y0 x1 y1)
  'todo)

; compute the shortest distance between three different points
; each pt# is a pair of values, (cons x y), of its position
(define (shortest-distance pt1 pt2 pt3)
  'todo)
