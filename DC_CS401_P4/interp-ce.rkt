;; Assignment 3: A CE (Control and Environment) interpreter for Scheme

(provide interp-ce)

; Your task is to write a CE interpreter for a substantial subset of Scheme/Racket. 
; A CE interpreter is meta-circular to a large degree (e.g., a conditional in the target
; language (scheme-ir?) can be implemented using a conditional in the host language (Racket),
; recursive evaluation of a sub-expression can be implemented as a recursive call to the
; interpreter, however, it's characterized by creating an explicit closure value for lambdas
; that saves its static environment (the environment when it's defined). For example, a CE
; interpreter for the lambda calculus may be defined:
(define (interp-ce-lambda exp [env (hash)])
  (match exp
         [`(lambda (,x) ,body)
          ; Return a closure that pairs the code and current (definition) environment
          `(closure (lambda (,x) ,body) ,env)]
         [`(,efun ,earg)
          ; Evaluate both sub-expressions
          (define vfun (interp-ce-lambda vfun env))  
          (define varg (interp-ce-lambda earg env))
          ; the applied function must be a closure
          (match-define `(closure (lambda (,x) ,body) ,env+) vfun)
          ; we extend the *closure's environment* and interp the body
          (interp-ce-lambda body (hash-set env+ x varg))]
         [(? symbol? x)
          ; Look up a variable in the current environment
          (hash-ref env x)]))

; Following is a predicate for the target language you must support. You must support any
; syntax allowed by scheme-ir that runs without error in Racket, returning a correct value..
(define (scheme-ir? exp)
  ; You should support a few built-in functions bound to the following variables at the top-level
  (define (prim? s) (member s '(+ - * = equal? list cons car cdr null?)))
  (match exp
         [`(lambda ,(? (listof symbol?)) ,(? scheme-ir?)) #t] ; fixed arguments lambda
         [`(lambda ,(? symbol?) ,(? scheme-ir?)) #t] ; variable argument lambda
         [`(if ,(? scheme-ir?) ,(? scheme-ir?) ,(? scheme-ir?)) #t]
         [`(let ([,(? symbol?) ,(? scheme-ir?)] ...) ,(? scheme-ir?)) #t]
         [`(let* ([,(? symbol?) ,(? scheme-ir?)] ...) ,(? scheme-ir?)) #t]
         [`(and ,(? scheme-ir?) ...) #t]
         [`(or ,(? scheme-ir?) ...) #t]
         [`(apply ,(? scheme-ir?) ,(? scheme-ir?)) #t]
         [(? (listof scheme-ir?)) #t]
         [(? prim?) #t]
         [(? symbol?) #t]
         [(? number?) #t]
         [(? boolean?) #t]
         [''() #t]
         [_ #f]))

; Interp-ce must correctly interpret any valid scheme-ir program and yield the same value
; as DrRacket, except for closures which must be represented as `(closure ,lambda ,environment).
; (+ 1 2) can return 3 and (cons 1 (cons 2 '())) can yield '(1 2). For programs that result in a 
; runtime error, you should return `(error ,message)---giving some reasonable string error message.
; Handling errors and some trickier cases will give bonus points. 
(define (interp-ce exp)
  ; Might add helpers or other code here...
  (define (interp exp env)
    (match exp
          [`(lambda ,args ,body)
              `(closure ,exp ,env)]

          ; ...
          ; Add match cases for other language forms
          ; ...
          [
           `(if ) 
          ]
           
           
           ; Untagged application case goes after all other forms
          [`(,ef ,eargs ...)
              ((interp ef env) (map (lambda (earg) (interp earg env)) eargs))]
          [(? symbol? x) (hash-ref env x)]))
  (interp exp [env (hash)]))
